      <p>
        "Pakistan's motivation for nuclear weapons arose from a need to prevent "nuclear blackmail" by India. Had Iraq and Libya been nuclear powers, they wouldn't have been destroyed in the way we have seen recently. ... If Pakistan had an atomic capability before 1971, we Pakistanis would not have lost half of our country after a disgraceful defeat."
